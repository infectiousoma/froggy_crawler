# froggy_crawler

Running froggy.py will add every frog code from the list. It doesn't add creator so you need to add it manually. It closes cleanly after completing the list and remembers the last index so it can resume. Requires you to manually log in and press enter in the terminal.

frog_finder clicks the search swamp button every 15 minutes, but for some reason it errors out. It fails when I manually click the button too.
